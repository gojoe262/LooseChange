# LooseChange
Loose Change is a website where you can quickly keep track of your spending and income. Please be patient as this project is still under development.

####Focus 1
Our primary focus is speed. We allow users to quickly add transactions. Unlike
traditional methods, such as Excel spreadsheets, our design and functionality focuses
on getting users quickly in and quickly out. Just go to the website, add a
transaction, and youâ€™re done. The focus on speed includes mobile friendly layouts
and load/save times.

We realize that our focus on speed does not allow much room for customizations by
the user. However, Loose Change has a narrow focus. It is designed to do few
things and do them well. We are willing to sacrifice flexibility in exchange for
simplicity.

####Focus 2
Our secondary focus is visual feedback. We generate charts and diagrams. This
provides visual feedback for the raw data.
